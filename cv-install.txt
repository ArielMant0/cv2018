Setup your homework environment
===============================

This exercise gives you no points, but it is required to do the other
exercises. If you have problems, do not hesitate to contact us.


a) Install Conda
----------------

To be able to run Jupyter Notebooks you will need Python. Follow this
exercise to get everything up and running.

We recommend to use Anaconda:

Download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/
that contains all important Python packages.

If you have limited diskspace install Miniconda
https://conda.io/miniconda.html instead, which contains only conda and
Python.  Follow the installation instructions on the web site.


b) Setup the cv environment
----------------------------

Download cv.yml from Stud.IP. Then in a terminal navigate to the
directory where you saved cv.yml and run

conda env create -f cv.yml 


c) Activate the environment
---------------------------

Always activate the enviornment when you work on the homework.

Linux/Mac OS:

   source activate cv

For Windows:

   activate cv

d) Run Jupyter Notebooks
------------------------

After you installed Python and the cv environment verify you are able
to run the notebook server by opening your command line

  jupyter notebook
  
Usually a browser window should open up. If not, open your favorite
webbrowser and navigate to localhost:8888/tree.
